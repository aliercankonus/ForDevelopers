ARRAY:
-Fixed size, costly insert and delete
+Fast lookup, fast append

Complexity
Space  O(N)
Lookup O(1)
Append O(1)
Insert O(N)
Delete O(N)

Why insert is costly. 

A-B-C-D-E we have 5 value in array. When Z is inserted between B and C, first C,D and E must be shifted and Z can be inserted.
A-B-Z-C-D-E. Because of shift operation is is cotly.
Delete is like insert. If C is deleted, other indexes will be shifted.

ARRAYLIST(Dynamic Array):
+Fast lookup, variable size
-Slow worstcase appends(10th element), costly insert and delete

When ArrayList is created, it has 10 memory area. If 11th index is added, new 20 memory area is created with new 10 memory area. 
After that all element is copied to new memory. Copy elementws takes O(N) time
Best case for appending O(1). We have 5 element and when new element is added, new area will not be created.
